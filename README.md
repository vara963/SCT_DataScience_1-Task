# SCT_DataScience_1-Task
"Task 1: Bar plot or histogram plot for data visualization."
This project generates two visualizations using a sample dataset. First, a bar chart is created to display the distribution of gender, showing the count for each category (Male, Female, Other). The count is annotated on top of the bars for clarity. Then, a histogram is used to show the age distribution, where the ages are randomly generated around a mean of 30. The chart also includes a kernel density estimate (KDE) to visualize the age spread. The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the gender and age data in a simple and clear way using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
